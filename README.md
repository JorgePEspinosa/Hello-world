# Hello-world
Hi every living being here!
My name is Jorge but everyone I care call me George, right know my adventures take me to the realm of programming and any other realm in these world called science, I have been a kind of hybrid spellcaster trying to conquerer engineering and biology but it was not enough to reach the goal, so I start a new conquest quest these time for python a computers to maybe obtain the the final power as a scripmancer. My first goal is conquering the python castel as its being told to me by ancient powers that it is a strategical ubication to start these new adventure.
I will continue to report any news via these method i suppose
